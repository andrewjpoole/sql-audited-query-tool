# Legolas Orchestration Report

**Date:** 2026-02-23T16:19:46Z  
**Agent:** Legolas (Frontend Dev)  
**Mode:** background  
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Task Summary
Fixed query results pane resize functionality across all UI panels with localStorage persistence.

## Problem Statement
Query results pane and other UI panels were not resizable. Users couldn't customize layout or use screen space efficiently.

## Solution Implemented
Implemented horizontal and vertical resize functionality with localStorage persistence across all major panels.

### Components Updated
- **App.tsx** — root layout resizing (left/right panes)
- **Chat.tsx** — chat panel vertical resizing (top/bottom)
- **TabbedSqlEditor.tsx** — editor panel resizing
- **QueryHistory.tsx** — history sidebar resizing
- **SchemaTreeView.tsx** — schema tree resizing

### Custom Hooks Created
- **useHorizontalResize** — manages left/right panel width dragging
- **useVerticalResize** — manages top/bottom panel height dragging

## Features
✅ Smooth drag interactions with visual feedback during resize  
✅ localStorage persistence — dimensions restored on page reload  
✅ Prevents accidental over-resize (min/max constraints)  
✅ All panels independently resizable  
✅ User preferences persist across sessions  

## Files Changed
- `ClientApp/src/App.tsx` — Root layout with resizing
- `ClientApp/src/components/Chat.tsx` — Chat panel vertical resizing
- `ClientApp/src/components/TabbedSqlEditor.tsx` — Editor resizing
- `ClientApp/src/components/QueryHistory.tsx` — Sidebar resizing
- `ClientApp/src/components/SchemaTreeView.tsx` — Schema tree resizing
- `ClientApp/src/hooks/useHorizontalResize.ts` — NEW hook for horizontal dragging
- `ClientApp/src/hooks/useVerticalResize.ts` — NEW hook for vertical dragging

## Testing
✅ All resize handles functional  
✅ localStorage persistence verified  
✅ Min/max constraints respected  
✅ Visual feedback smooth during drag  
✅ No regression in existing functionality  

## User Impact
- Flexible layout control — users can customize workspace
- Persistent preferences — layout restored across sessions
- Professional UX — drag interactions are smooth and responsive

## Accessibility Notes
- Resize handles have sufficient hit targets (12+ pixels)
- Visual feedback (cursor change) during drag
- No keyboard accessibility required (enhanced on next iteration)
